# Role : Quant Researcher

# Test
3 challenging Probability puzzles. We had to give a descriptive answer.
I think they shortlisted people who solved 2 or more.


# Interview
2 Rounds of Interview, first round was just probability puzzles.
One question I remember is given a coin and a fraction p/q, how would I make a game wherein player A has a p/q chance of winning and player B has a 1-p/q chance of winning.

Follow up to this was what should I do if I replace p/q with an irrational number.
