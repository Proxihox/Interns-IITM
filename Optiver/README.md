# Test
The test had 5 parts

## Sequences test
Fill in the blanks for sequences, problems were of slightly higher than NTSE level.

## Probability test
10 probability questions in increasing order of difficulty, with time limit of 1 min per question. They give options which aren't exact and ask you to give nearest option. They don't expect you to actually solve the hard problems(last 4), but instead give a good guess as all options are well spread.
