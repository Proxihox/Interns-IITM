# Role : Quant Trader

# Test
The test had 5 parts

## Sequences test
Fill in the blanks for sequences, problems were of slightly higher than NTSE level.

## Probability test
10 probability questions in increasing order of difficulty, with time limit of 1 min per question. They give options which aren't exact and ask you to give nearest option. They don't expect you to actually solve the hard problems(last 4), but instead give a good guess as all options are well spread.

# Interview Round 1
Read the document provided by Optiver thoroughly before hand. Understanding of what market making is essential.

First they made us play a market making game. It has 5 rounds and we make an upper and lower bid for every round. If the actual value is within the upper and lower bound, our score increases by lower bound/upper bound. There was no strict time limit, but I think I took less than a minute per question and he was fine with it.

These type of questions are called Fermi questions. 

### Example Market making
Make a market on size of IIT Madras campus in acres.

I put a bid price(upper bound) of 700 acres and an ask price(lower bound) of 500 acres.

The actual area is within the range 500 to 700 acres, hence I get 500/700 points for this round. 

I practiced market making on these sites:
1.https://www.tradermath.org/market-games/market-taking-game/lobby
2.https://www.tradinginterview.com/2-important-market-making-games-for-trading-interviews/

I've remade the questions so you can play it here. You need to score at least 2 points in the 5 rounds to win this game.

## Strategy

The general idea is to come up with a calculated guess for the value asked and then based on our confidence of our guess being right, we give an upper and lower bound, centered around our guess. 

I came up with 2 strategies:
1. Ask to Bid ratio is 2/3, need to get 3 guesses right. 

2. Ask to Bid ratio is 1/2, need to get 4 guesses right.

I went ahead with the first strategy and got only 2 guesses right, for a score of (2/3 + 4/5) = 22/15 . After the game got over, I realised that I would have scored 2 points, if I had used the second strategy.
