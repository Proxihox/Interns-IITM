# Role : Hardware

# Test
Simple test in System verilog language. Syntax very similar to Verilog.

They gave sample code to check if a 32 bit input matches with a reference 32 bit key. The question was to implement a module which will check if a stream of 6 32 bit inputs will match with a 32*6 = 192 bit key.

# Interview
2 questions, 1.5 hours

## Question 1
They gave the code "q1.v" and asked us to give the logic gate realisation of that code.

## Question 2
We are building a scanner which scans the ID of 2 objects, uses the ID to fetch the weight of the object and then compares the weigths. Explain how you will build a digital circuit to solve this.
