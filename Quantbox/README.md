# Role : Quant Researcher

# Test
Coding test with 5 decently challenging problems. I got SL by implementing brute force solution for all 5 problems.


# Interview
They ask 3 standard hard puzzles. By standard I mean that if you google them you will find a similar if not the exact same problem. Keep in mind that the questions will be of the hard category, i.e minimum brainstellar hard level.s
