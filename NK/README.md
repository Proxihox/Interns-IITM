# Role : Quant Researcher

# Test
Had questions on probability and CS fundamentals. 2 Coding questions.
1 of the coding questions was a very had CP question. Luckily, the output was either Yes or No, so I just wrote a program which always returns No and passed 14/24 testcases. The other question was implementation of a trade ledger. Basically it had to record buys and sells of various stocks. Was an implementation heavy problem.

# Interview
Asked me difference between malloc and new and a bunch of other questions about C++.
